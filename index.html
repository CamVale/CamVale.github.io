            <h2>This character's name is Valerie Cherish</h2>
            <p>
                I am writing some of Valerie's best moments, but first
                here is a synopsis of The Comeback: The Comeback is an
                American comedy-drama television series produced by HBO 
                that stars Lisa Kudrow as sitcom actress Valerie Cherish 
                in modern-day Los Angeles. It was created by Kudrow and 
                Michael Patrick King, a former executive producer of Sex 
                and the City. Kudrow and King are also screenwriters and 
                executive producers of the series, with King also serving 
                as the director of some episodes. The series originally 
                aired for a single season of 13 episodes from June 5 to 
                September 4, 2005, before being cancelled. Nine years 
                later, The Comeback was revived for a second season of 
                eight episodes that aired from November 9 to December 28, 2014.
